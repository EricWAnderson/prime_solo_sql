#SQL Syntax Solo Challenge
In this challenge, we’re going to practice performing SQL queries. This should help better solidify some concepts that were covered during lecture.

#Questions
1. Which authors are represented in our store?
2. Which authors are also distinguished authors?
3. Which authors are not distinguished authors?
4. How many authors are represented in our store?
5. Who are the favorite authors of the employee with the first name of Michael?
6. What are the titles of all the books that are in stock today?
7. Insert one of your favorite books into the database. Hint: You’ll want to create data in at least 2 other tables to completely create this book.
8. What authors have books that are not in stock?
9. What is the title of the book that has the most stock?

#Exercise - Hard Mode
Store the answers for this in the same repo, but in a file named “hard_mode.sql”.
Design a database that tracks customers and their orders.

The following are the minimums for records in each table.
- At least 5 customer records.
- At least 10 orders.
- At least 5 products.
- Products should have a price.
